Crop Recommendation System - Machine Learning Model ðŸŒ±
Made by Subrata Dhibar (2nd Year Project)
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable crops for a given farm based on several environmental factors. The model analyzes input data such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide tailored recommendations for farmers, thereby aiding in precision agriculture.

Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language.
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, joblib
Data Analysis: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
Web Interface: Streamlit for interactive dashboard.
Project Overview:
Key Features:
Data Exploration: The dataset is analyzed for structure, types, and uniqueness. It handles missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
Model Training: Various machine learning models are trained, including:
Logistic Regression (LR)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees (CART)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Ensemble Methods like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.
Model Selection: The most suitable model is chosen based on cross-validation scores, and the model is optimized using grid search.
Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports to ensure precision in predictions.
User Interface:
Streamlit is used to create an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
Farmers can input various environmental parameters and get the predicted crop recommendations.
Features like crop information and working mechanism are included in the sidebar for better user engagement.
Main Code Structure:
Data Handling:
The dataset is loaded, duplicates are removed, and outliers are handled for cleaner data.
The dataset is split into training and testing subsets.
Model Training:
Multiple machine learning models are tested, and the best performing model is selected for crop prediction.
Prediction and Output:
The trained model is deployed in a web interface where users can input farm data, and the model will predict suitable crops.
The result is displayed in real-time on the web page.
