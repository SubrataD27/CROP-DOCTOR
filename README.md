# **Crop Recommendation System - Machine Learning Model** ðŸŒ±

## **Made by Subrata Dhibar (2nd Year Project)**

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable crops for a given farm based on several environmental factors. The model analyzes input data such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide tailored recommendations for farmers, thereby aiding in precision agriculture.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn, joblib
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit for interactive dashboard.
